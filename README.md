## ✨ Key Features
- Mobile Emulation: Automatically simulates a Google Pixel 7 environment using Chrome DevTools Protocol.
- Self-Healing Popup Handler: Built-in logic in actions.py to detect and dismiss intrusive UI elements during execution.
- Automated Step-by-Step Screenshots:
  - Captures screenshots for every critical action, saved in screenshots directory.
  - Failure Snapshot: Automatically triggers a full-page screenshot upon test failure via Pytest hooks.
- Interactive Reports: Generates a self-contained HTML report with execution details and embedded logs.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome Browser

2. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal and run:
```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Tests
You can execute the tests using either of the following methods:

- Option A: Batch Script (Windows)
  Double-click run_test.bat. This will automatically install missing packages and trigger the test suite.
- Option B: Command Line
 ```text
  pytest -vs --html=report.html --self-contained-html
  ```

## 📊 Results & Artifacts
- HTML Report: Open report.html in any browser to view the test summary.
- Screenshots: Check the screenshots/ directory for chronological captures of the test flow.

## 📝 Test Workflow (Twitch Search)
1. Initialize: Navigate to Twitch Mobile and clear initial popups.
2. Search: Click the search icon and input "StarCraft II".
3. Filter: Navigate to the "Channels" tab.
4. Browse: Perform a vertical scroll (x2) to load dynamic content.
5. Selection: Randomly select a live streamer from the results.
6. Validation: Wait for the video player to load, verify playback state, and take a final confirmation screenshot.
